    "We are going to walk thru a brute force procedural method for inverting a matrix with pure Python. Why wouldn’t we just use numpy? Great question. This blog is about tools that add efficiency **_AND_** _clarity_. I love numpy, pandas, sklearn, and all the great tools that the python data science community brings to us, but I have learned that the better I understand the “innards” of a thing, the better I know how to apply it. Plus, *tomorrows machine learning tools will be developed by those that understand the **innards** of the math and coding of today’s tools.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, once an efficient method of matrix inversion is understood, you are ~ 80% of the way to having your own Least Squares Solver and a component to many other personal analysis modules to help you better understand how all our great machine learning tools are built. Would I recommend that you use what we are about to develop for a real project? All those python modules mentioned above are lightening fast, so, usually, no. I would not recommend that you use your own such tools **UNLESS** you are working with smaller problems, **OR** you are investigating some new approach that requires slight changes to your personal tool suite. Thus, a statement above bears repeating: *tomorrows machine learning tools will be developed by those that understand the **innards** of the math and coding of today’s tools.* I want to be part of, or at least foster, those that will make the next gen tools. Plus, if you are a geek, knowing how to code the inversion of a matrix is fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I was taught to inverse matrices, *in the dark ages that is*, was pure torture! If you go about it the way that you would program it, it is MUCH easier in my opinion. I would even think it’s easier doing the method we will use when doing it by hand than the ancient teaching of how to do it. In fact, it is so easy that we will start with a 5x5 matrix to make it “clearer”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DON’T PANIC.** The only really painful thing about it, is that, while it’s very simple, it’s a bit tedious and boring. However, compared to the ancient method, it’s simple. Or, as one of my favorite mentors would commonly say, “It’s simple. it’s just not easy.” We’ll use python, to reduce the tedium, without losing any view to the insights of the methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use python at first through a Jupyter notebook to clearly illustrate each step. Then, we’ll be VERY ready to adapt those steps to build our own module. I will seek to be very pep8’ish. Please deviate from my style as you wish to make what we are doing your own and more clear to you. You’ll be glad that you did.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logo for the github repo that stores all this work, really says it all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the main rule of algebra (whatever we do to one side of the equal sign, we will do to the other side of the equal sign, in order to “stay true” to the equal sign), we will perform row operations to **A** in order to methodically turn it into an identity matrix while applying those same steps to what is “initially” the identity matrix on the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "When what was __A__ becomes an identity matrix, what was I on the right will become **A-1**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If at some point, you have a big **“Ah HA!”** moment, try to work ahead on your own and compare to what we’ve done once you’ve finished or if you get stuck. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook called **MatrixInversion.ipynb** can be obtained from the [github repo](https://github.com/ThomIves/MatrixInverse) for this project. You don’t need to use Jupyter to follow along. I’ve also saved the cells as MatrixInversion.py in the same repo. Let’s first define a function that will give us a nice printout of the matrices we’ll be manipulating."
