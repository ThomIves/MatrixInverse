# Matrix Inverse
> A step by step explanation of how to inverse a matrix using a jupyter notebook and python scripts.

The Jupyter notebooks walks thru a brute force procedural method for inverting a matrix with pure Python. Why wouldn’t we just use numpy? Great question. This work is about creating tools that add efficiency AND clarity. I love numpy, pandas, sklearn, and all the great tools that the python data science community brings to us, but I have learned that the better I understand the “innards” of a thing, the better I know how to apply it. Plus, tomorrow's machine learning tools will be developed by those that understand the "innards" of the math and coding of today’s tools. 


## Getting started

1. DevelopmentNotebook.ipynb contains the brute force code used to explain the method on the YouTube video.
2. DevelopmentNotebook.py is a python script version of DevelopmentNotebook.ipynb for those that do not use Jupyter notebooks.
3. MatrixInversion3x3StepbyStep.txt is a detailed step-by-step explanation of the procedure, manually speaking, on a 3x3 matrix.
4. MatrixInversion5x5StepbyStep.txt is a detailed step-by-step explanation of the procedure, manually speaking, on a 5x5 matrix.
5. MatrixInverseStepByStep.ipynb is the programming used to create MatrixInversionXxXStepbyStep.txt, because I was TOO LAZY to have done all of the MatrixInversionXxXStepbyStep.txt work by hand!
6. MatrixInversion.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that walks you through the inversion programming steps.
7. MatrixInversion.py is for those that do not use Jupyter notebooks.
8. Finally, LinearAlgebraPurePython.py is a module file to be imported and have it's functions called in basic linear algebra work.
9. LinearAlgebraPractice.py is a simple python script that imports LinearAlgebraPurePython.py and uses it's functions.


## Deploying / Publishing

I would appreciate it, as you share your work leveraged from this set of scripts, if you would please keep a referral back to my github repo. Thanks! I'd do the same for you. :-)

## Contributing

I am open to share the development and improvements of this with others, but it has been solo up until now. Let me know if you'd like to contribute.
